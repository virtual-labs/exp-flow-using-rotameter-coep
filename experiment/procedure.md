### Procedure

- Fill the sump tank with water.
- Open the SV valve (solenoid valve). 
- Switch on the pump and change the flow with the help of variable frequency drive VFD.
- Allow the unit to come to a steady state as indicated by constant position of the float in Rotameter.
- After steady state is reached record the flow rate indicated on the scale of the Rotameter.
- Take the reading for 1 min and find the length of water in side glass for different flow rates.
- Repeat the above for at least six-seven runs starting from the minimum flow rate and going to a maximum value.
