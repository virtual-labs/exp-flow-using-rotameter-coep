# Procedure

### Configuration:-
- select pipe size , fluid type and float material according to fluid type check/click the configuration button
- click on next level 

### Basic Knowledge - 
- Answer all the questions and click on next level

### Simulation

- Open the SV valve (solenoid valve). 
- Switch on the pump and change the flow with the help of variable frequency drive VFD
- Allow the unit to come to a steady state as indicated by constant position of the float in Rotameter
- After steady state is reached record the flow rate indicated on the scale of the Rotameter
- Take the reading and find the length of water in side glass for different flow rates
- Calculate the flow of rotameter and submit the answer
- Repeat the above for at least six-seven runs starting from the minimum flow rate and going to a maximum value

### Calibration

- Calculate zero error and submit  answer
- Calculate span error and submit answer
- Adjust the zero error by clicking plus and minus buttons
- Follow above process to adjust span error

### Fault Finding:
1. Observe the shown table and select the fault accordingly
2. After selecting the correct fault Result will be displayed
